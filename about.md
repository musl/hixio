# Hi. I'm Mike.

I like to write code for many things: the web; embedded projects; to
draw fractals; to automate ops; and more. When I'm not coding, managing
risk, hosting DevOps meet-ups, or just figuring out how it works. The
rest of the time, I'm playing with my son, playing Kerbal Space Program,
playing overwatch, working on my house, or cooking.
