# Hi. I'm Mike.
I like to write ruby for the web.
I like to write programs in various languages that draw beautiful fractals.
I like to explore math, physics, logic, epistemology, electronics, and music.
I like writing away ops tasks with code, which I do for money at [New Relic](http://newrelic.com).
